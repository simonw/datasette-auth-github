Datasette plugin that authenticates users against GitHub.

This requires [Datasette 0.44](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-44) or later.

## Setup instructions

* Install the plugin - `pip install datasette-auth-github`
* Create a GitHub OAuth app: https://github.com/settings/applications/new
* Set the Authorization callback URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/auth-callback`
* Create a `metadata.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "title": "datasette-auth-github demo",
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-auth-github": {
            "client_id": {"$env": "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"},
            "client_secret": {"$env": "GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"}
        }
    }
}
```

Now you can start Datasette like this, passing in the secrets as environment variables:

    $ GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=XXX GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YYY datasette \
        fixtures.db -m metadata.json

Note that hard-coding secrets in `metadata.json` is a bad idea as they will be visible to anyone who can navigate to `/-/metadata`. Instead, we use a new mechanism for [adding secret plugin configuration options](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#secret-configuration-values).

By default anonymous users will still be able to interact with Datasette. If you wish all users to have to sign in with a GitHub account first, add this to your ``metadata.json``:

```json
{
    "allow": {
        "id": "*"
    },
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-auth-github": {
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
}
```
## The authenticated actor

Visit `/-/actor` when signed in to see the shape of the authenticated actor. It should look something like this:

```json
{
    "actor": {
        "display": "simonw",
        "gh_id": "9599",
        "gh_name": "Simon Willison",
        "gh_login": "simonw",
        "gh_email": "...",
        "gh_orgs": [
            "dogsheep",
            "datasette-project"
        ],
        "gh_teams": [
            "dogsheep/test"
        ]
    }
}
```

The `gh_orgs` and `gh_teams` properties will only be present if you used `load_teams` or `load_orgs`, documented below.

## Restricting access to specific users

You can use Datasette's [permissions mechanism](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html) to specify which user or users are allowed to access your instance. Here's how to restrict access to just GitHub user `simonw`:

```json
{
    "allow": {
        "gh_login": "simonw"
    },
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-auth-github": {
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

This `"allow"` block can be positioned at the database, table or query level instead: see [Configuring permissions in metadata.json](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#configuring-permissions-in-metadata-json) for details.

## Restricting access to specific GitHub organizations or teams

You can also restrict access to users who are members of a specific GitHub organization.

You'll need to configure the plugin to check if the user is a member of that organization when they first sign in. You can do that using the `"load_orgs"` plugin configuration option.

Then you can use `"allow": {"gh_orgs": [...]}` to specify which organizations are allowed access.

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-auth-github": {
            "...": "...",
            "load_orgs": ["your-organization"]
        }
    },
    "allow": {
        "gh_orgs": "your-organization"
    }
}
```

If your organization is [arranged into teams](https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-members-into-teams) you can restrict access to a specific team like this:

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-auth-github": {
            "...": "...",
            "load_teams": [
                "your-organization/staff",
                "your-organization/engineering",
            ]
        }
    },
    "allows": {
        "gh_team": "your-organization/engineering"
    }
}
```
